### **Result**

Thus the current series  feedback amplifier is designed and constructed  and the following parameters are calculated.
| S.No | Parameters | Without Feedback | With Feedback |
|:----:|-------------|:----------------:|:--------------:|
| 1 | Lower cut-off frequency | f1=610Hz | f1"=360kHz |
| 2 | Upper cut-off frequency | f2=470khz | f2"= 270khz|
| 3 | Bandwidth | ( BW = fh - fl = 419.39khz) | ( BW = f'h - f'l =269.64khz ) |
| 4 | Mid-band Gain | ( A{v(mid)} = 12.88) | ( A'{v(mid)} = 8.40) |
| 5 | Gain at half power point | 9.40 | 5.93|

---

**Conclusion:**  
The frequency response of the current series feedback amplifier was studied. It was observed that the **gain decreases** while the **bandwidth increases** when negative feedback is applied, confirming the theoretical expectations.
